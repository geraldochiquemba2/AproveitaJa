The user has attached a detailed specification for a completely different website - "Aproveita Já" - which is a marketplace for selling products near expiration date. This is NOT the architecture portfolio website I just created.

I need to:

Understand that the user wants me to build this new marketplace website instead
This is a complete pivot from the architecture portfolio
I should clarify with the user if they want me to replace the current website or if this is a different project
Let me read the requirements carefully:

Marketplace connecting Stores/Supermarkets to Buyers
Focus on products near expiration or surplus
Store/Seller interface with login via phone number
Product listing with mandatory fields (name, original/discounted price, expiration date, store name, exact location, logistics supervisor contact, photo)
Auto-expiration: products disappear 10 days after listing
Buyer interface - public marketplace
Buyers see products, discounted price (+15% fee), store name
Buyers DON'T see supervisor contact or exact location
Checkout requires login/registration with phone and exact location
Option for pickup or delivery
Admin interface with fixed credentials (phone: 9123456789, password: 123456789)
Admin sees all orders with full details for logistics coordination
Mobile-friendly, optimized for Angola
This is a complex marketplace application with three different user roles (Store/Seller, Buyer, Admin) and requires authentication, product management, order management, and logistics coordination.

I should ask the user if they want me to:

Replace the architecture portfolio with this marketplace
Start fresh with this new project
Actually, looking at the context, the user provided this specification directly, so they clearly want me to build this instead of the architecture portfolio. I should acknowledge what they want and start building it.

Let me create a new plan for this marketplace application.

Entendo! Você quer criar o marketplace "Aproveita Já" em vez do site de arquitetura. Vou desenvolver este marketplace para conectar lojas/supermercados a compradores, com foco em produtos próximos da validade. O sistema terá três interfaces distintas: Vendedor (lojas), Comprador (público) e Administrador (coordenação logística).
